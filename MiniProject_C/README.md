# Project Information

# Introduction
A fully featured time Scheduling algorithms which evalutes the results of turn around time and waiting times of the schedulers. The project includes algorithms of different time schedulers in one application. it is the combing of the all time schedulers In the operating system I find every much became the problem is simple but it is lengthy. In this process with small mistake makes wrong solution. So that I think to devlop the time scheduling algorithms. It is developed on C language with the proper testing and makefile.

# Research
I done so much research to known the logics of the code from internet and my operating system textbook. From these two ways I add so many new things to the code We can easily access the data and update the data without a pen and a paper.

# Cost and Features
Cost charged on the application is zero, as it is essential for all citizens of the country, no cost is charged. To get the patent and permission for the application it will cost. As this is application is at begining stage.

# Defining Our System
The automatic procedure of time scheduler to find the turn around time and other measures by using this application.in this process.user want to give the no of the process and burst time and other quiries to find the automatic result of the respective time scheduler in the application.
